	Abstract = {
        In planning for deliberation or navigation in real-world robotic systems, 
        one of the big challenges is to cope with change. 
        It lies in the nature of planning that it has to make assumptions about the future state of the world, 
        and the robot's chances of successively accomplishing actions in this future. Hence, a robot's plan can only be as good as its predictions about the world.
        In this paper, we present a novel approach to specifically represent changes that stem from \emph{periodic} events in the environment (e.g. a door being opened or closed), 
        which impact on the success probability of planned actions. 
        We show that our approach to model the probability of action success as a set of superimposed periodic processes allows the robot to predict action outcomes 
        in a long-term data obtained in two real-life offices better than a static model. 
        We furthermore discuss and showcase how this knowledge gathered can be successfully employed in a probabilistic planning framework to devise better navigation plans.
        The key contributions of this paper are (i) the formation of the spectral model of action outcomes from non-uniform sampling, 
        the (ii) analysis of its predictive power using two long-term datasets, and (iii) the application of the predicted outcomes in an MDP-based planning framework.},

@article{GPD1,
abstract = {Recently, a number of grasp detection methods have been proposed that can be used to localize robotic grasp configurations directly from sensor data without estimating object pose. The underlying idea is to treat grasp perception analogously to object detection in computer vision. These methods take as input a noisy and partially occluded RGBD image or point cloud and produce as output pose estimates of viable grasps, without assuming a known CAD model of the object. Although these methods generalize grasp knowledge to new objects well, they have not yet been demonstrated to be reliable enough for wide use. Many grasp detection methods achieve grasp success rates (grasp successes as a fraction of the total number of grasp attempts) between 75{\%} and 95{\%} for novel objects presented in isolation or in light clutter. Not only are these success rates too low for practical grasping applications, but the light clutter scenarios that are evaluated often do not reflect the realities of real world grasping. This paper proposes a number of innovations that together result in a significant improvement in grasp detection performance. The specific improvement in performance due to each of our contributions is quantitatively measured either in simulation or on robotic hardware. Ultimately, we report a series of robotic experiments that average a 93{\%} end-to-end grasp success rate for novel objects presented in dense clutter.},

@inproceedings{GPD2,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of grasp pose detection in point clouds. We follow a general algorithmic structure that first generates a large set of 6-DOF grasp candidates and then classifies each of them as a good or a bad grasp. Our focus in this paper is on improving the second step by using depth sensor scans from large online datasets to train a convolutional neural network. We propose two new representations of grasp candidates, and we quantify the effect of using prior knowledge of two forms: instance or category knowledge of the object to be grasped, and pretraining the network on simulated depth data obtained from idealized CAD models. Our analysis shows that a more informative grasp candidate representation as well as pretraining and prior knowledge significantly improve grasp detection. We evaluate our approach on a Baxter Research Robot and demonstrate an average grasp success rate of 93{\%} in dense clutter. This is a 20{\%} improvement compared to our prior work.},
